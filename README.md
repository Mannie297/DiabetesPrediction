# DiabetesPrediction
## Exploring the Diabetes Dataset to predict the likelihood of a patient been diagnosed with diabetes.
The data consists of diagnostic information about some patients who have been tested for diabetes. The final column in the dataset (Diabetic) contains the value 0 for patients who tested negative for diabetes, and 1 for patients who tested positive. This is the label that the model will be trained to predict. Most of the other columns (Pregnancies, PlasmaGlucose, DiastolicBloodPressure, and so on) are the features that will be used to predict the Diabetic label.

This dataset will be used to train a model to predict the likelihood of a patient been diagnosed with diabetes before subjecting the patient to a test. This has the effect of minimizing cost of diabetic tests.
